All files were downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, unzipped, and placed in the same directory.

The working directory for the scrip run_analysis.R is set to the working directory containing the data files.

The variable mergedSet includes the merged training and test sets.

The files "features.txt", "subject_test.txt", "subject_train.txt", "X_test.txt", "X_train.txt", "y_test.txt", "y-train.txt" were read into memory.

The subject IDs were added to the data by combining the columns.

The activity codes were added to the data by combining the columns.

The activity code column was renamed in order to avoid column name duplication in the combined set.
The subject ID column was renamed subject_ID.

The training and test sets were combined by combining the rows by matched columns.

Descriptive activity names were added to the data set based on the activity codes (mergedSet).

Then a subset was selected that contained subject IDs,activity names, and measurements pertaining to mean and standard deviation (selectedSet).
 
TidySet: Created an independent data set from the data set in the previous step, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
